# initial-matrix-command-line-tool

This is the initial version of my 'matrix comand line tool'. For a more complete version, please see [matrix command line tool](https://github.com/arteen1000/matrix-command-line-tool).

This program is capable of taking in dynamic user input, performing input validation, and using it to perform three basic matrix operations:

- scalar multiplication
- matrix addition
- matrix multiplication

After I had already completed the project, and was getting ready to add more operations, I realized that having the user input their row and column data manually took too much time, so I had the idea to allow them to input matrix data by row and have the program figure out their row and column data.

For that version, please the link above.
